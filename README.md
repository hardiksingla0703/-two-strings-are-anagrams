# C++ Anagram Checker

## Overview
This C++ program checks whether two given words are **anagrams** of each other. Two words are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters but in a different order.

## How It Works
1. The program takes two strings as input from the user.
2. It checks if the strings have the same length. If they don't, the program immediately returns that the strings are **not anagrams**.
3. If the lengths are the same, the program sorts both strings alphabetically and compares them.
4. If the sorted strings match, they are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.
